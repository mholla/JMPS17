# JMPS17

This code reproduces the results of Holland et al. JMPS 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmps.2016.09.012).

The calculations (root and minima finding) and plotting are performed separately (by JMPS17_calculate.py and JMPS_plot.py, respectively) for efficiency. Additionally, the output of both scripts are included.
